# Needfinding Report: Fitness App Design

## Motivation and Problem Selection

The goal of this project was to analyze user needs for a fitness app by identifying their challenges, pain points, and objectives when using fitness technology. My motivation for choosing this topic stemmed from a common frustration: I found myself relying on multiple apps to track different aspects of my fitness journey. One app for calorie counting, another for step tracking, and yet another for workout routines. Despite the abundance of fitness apps available, there seems to be no single solution that seamlessly integrates all these features. This personal experience, along with similar frustrations shared by many others, inspired me to explore this problem further. By conducting research and interviewing individuals with diverse fitness backgrounds, I aimed to identify these gaps and provide valuable insights for designing a more comprehensive and user-friendly fitness app.

## Needfinding Methodology

### Participant Selection and Recruitment

To gain diverse insights, I conducted interviews with three individuals, each with unique experiences and fitness goals. Participants were selected based on their familiarity with fitness apps and their distinct approaches to fitness. This diversity was key to capturing a broad range of use cases. While all participants maintained a regular fitness routine, their engagement with fitness apps varied: some used them consistently, others occasionally, and some not at all. The participants were:

- **Noah (pseudonym)**: A climber and weightlifter who follows a weekly workout routine targeting different muscle groups each day. She is very mindful of her calorie intake but does not use fitness apps due to past negative experiences with calorie-counting apps linked to eating disorders.
- **Arthur (pseudonym)**: A college student seeking a simple way to track his steps and maintain a fitness routine. He uses an app called Exercise primarily for step counting.
- **Zain (pseudonym)**: A fitness trainer based in New York (originally from South Asia) who consistently uses multiple fitness apps in his fitness journey. His focus is on both step counting and calorie tracking, utilizing StepsApp for step tracking and either MyFitnessPal or Lose It for food logging.

### Interview Process and Questions

Interviews were conducted in-person and virtually to accommodate participant preferences and schedules. Key questions included:

#### Fitness Routine & Technology Use:
- What is your fitness routine like, and how does technology play a role in it?
- Do you currently use any fitness apps? Which ones and why? If not, why? Have you used any fitness app before?
- How often do you use the app, and what features do you use most frequently?

#### User Needs & Challenges:
- Have you ever felt frustrated or disappointed using the app? If so, what happened?
- Are there any tasks or features you wish the app could do but currently cannot?

#### Goals and Motivation:
- What goals are you trying to achieve using the app (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain)?
- How does the app help or hinder your progress toward those goals?
- What motivates you to keep using the app? What could cause you to stop using it?

#### Suggestions & Improvements:
- What would make the app easier or more enjoyable to use?
- If you could design the perfect fitness app, what would it include?

## Interview Results and Analysis

### Key Themes Across Interviews

Through the three interviews, I uncovered a range of perspectives on existing fitness and nutrition apps. While some participants shared common frustrations, others revealed unique pain points based on their personal habits, cultural backgrounds, and technological preferences.

- **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: Many participants expressed frustration with complex and cluttered app designs. Noah explained, "I prefer minimalistic designs in apps with a monochrome color scheme or at least an option to choose the interface color. It reduces visual overload and makes the app more enjoyable to use." Similarly, Zain shared his frustration, saying, "It was hard for me to find the feature to log the previous day's calories in ‘MyFitnessPal.'" These insights highlight usability issues, where essential features are not easily accessible.
  
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Participants felt that many fitness apps lacked comprehensive tracking features. Both Noah and Zain emphasized the need for tracking beyond calories. As Noah put it, "I want an app that can recommend workouts based on my previous exercises and challenge me to step up my routine." Zain added, "The app should include food groups specific to various cultures," pointing out that fitness apps often overlook these crucial aspects, leaving users without a full picture of their health.
  
- **Personalization & Flexibility**: The desire for more personalized features was strongly emphasized. Noah voiced, "I want an app that can recommend workouts based on my previous exercises and challenge me to step up my routine." She also highlighted the importance of flexibility in workout suggestions, including recovery periods, to better support her individual fitness goals as an athlete.
  
- **Motivational Features**: Motivation was identified as critical to maintaining fitness routines. Arthur noted, "My app calculates the number of steps I need to take to reach my weight loss goal, but it would be nice to have something on the home screen or a streak system like Duolingo." Noah also added, "I’d love a visual representation of my fitness routine, like a graph showing my progress over days and months."

### Pain Points

Several major pain points emerged through these three interviews:

- **Lack of Integration**: Zain stated, "I have to use different apps for fitness, nutrition, and workouts. It makes tracking less effective because my data is all over the place."
  
- **Limited Nutritional Insights**: Zain also noted, "Sometimes I feel like I have a nutrient deficit. If the app could tell me, ‘You had X amount of carbohydrates more or Y amount of protein less today,’ I could balance my diet better the next day."
  
- **Workout Tracking Deficiencies**: Noah pointed out, "Most fitness apps lack features like tracking muscle groups and recovery periods, which are really important for me as a weightlifter and climber."

### Key Takeaways

- Users prefer minimalistic, easy-to-navigate designs.
- Comprehensive tracking features, such as hydration, sleep, and muscle recovery, are essential.
- Integration of fitness, nutrition, and recovery data is crucial.
- Personalized and flexible workout plans can boost long-term user engagement.
- Culturally inclusive nutritional tracking is necessary to cater to diverse users.

### Tensions, Contradictions, and Surprises

#### Contradictions:
- While some participants sought highly detailed tracking, others found such features overwhelming. Zain wanted deep insights into macronutrients and calorie intake, while Noah found calorie statistics discouraging due to her past struggles with eating disorders. This highlights the need to balance functionality with simplicity.

#### Surprises:
- A significant surprise was the cultural aspect of nutrition tracking. Many users struggled with apps that did not recognize their food habits, highlighting an often-overlooked issue.

#### Tensions:
- There was a clear tension between personalization and ease of use. Highly customized apps can feel too complex, contradicting the desire for minimalism.
